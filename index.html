    <h1>What is Usability ?</h1>

    <p>
      Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a 
      product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily. 
      Designers usually measure a design’s usability throughout the development process—from 
      wireframes to the final deliverable—to ensure maximum usability.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Usability is about human behavior. It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional, 
      are not interested in putting a lot of effort into, say, getting a credit card and 
      generally prefer things that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do.”
